`Note: Instead of form, you can put your email address and/or mobile number.`


## Submission Instructions

- Put you HTML code in the `index.html` file. Replit will use this file as the starting point for the project. You can add additional `css` inline or in separate files. 
- Use the `Run` button at the top (in centre) of the screen to preview your page. 
- Use the `Submit` button at the top right side of the screen to submit your project.
